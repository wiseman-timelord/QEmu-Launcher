## REQUIREMENTS

### INSTALLATION:
1. Download, and drop the files into QEmu.
2. Ensure you have followed setup requirements for QEmu for your hardware, meaning, Hyper-V OR Hypervisor, not both. Hypervisor is AMD, while Hyper-V is Intel.
3. Run the batch, follow logic. If you have issues, then run the diagnostic, and feed the detoiled output into GPT with brief prompt at the start.
4. I ran into the issue shown below, and my internet ran out...end of line.

### DEVELOPMENT:
- Am making an effort to get QEmu working, I think my windows needs re-install with early install of WSL2/Hypervisor (and install distros), and all other related setting up, before I de-brand/hack the OS to be anti-ms spyware/bloat. 
- Recently have a, Patreon and Kofi, Â£15 will pay for internet for a month, so, yes you can make a difference to the project, with just a little donation.
