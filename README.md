## REQUIREMENTS

### INSTALLATION:
1. Download, and drop the files into QEmu.
2. Ensure you have followed setup requirements for QEmu for your hardware, meaning, Hyper-V OR Hypervisor, not both. Hypervisor is AMD, while Hyper-V is Intel.
3. Run the batch, follow logic. If you have issues, then run the diagnostic, and feed the detoiled output into GPT with brief prompt at the start.
4. I ran into the issue shown below, and my internet ran out...end of line.

### DEVELOPMENT:
- Development Paused; I tried so very hard to get QEmu working, but I think my windows needs re-install, and when I do, I need ensure to install, Hypervisor AND WSL 2 (and install distro), and all other related setting up, before I de-brand/hack the OS. Asside from that, like it says in my Status. Here was my final work, but it doesnt have to be that way, please find the time to, Patreon or Kofi, a minimum of Â£15, and I can continue to have internet, yes it is that bad.
